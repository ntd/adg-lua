ADG-Lua 0.1.1
=============

adg-demo.lua is now in par with the adg-demo.c included in ADG
canvas 0.7.2.


ADG-Lua 0.1.0
=============

First release entirely based on LGI. LGI bindings provide two main
benefits over LGob: they work out of the box with both ADG and CPML
and they have more mainstream acceptance.

The fact that LGI and ADG work together without further assistance
makes this very same project useless, and in fact actually adg-lua
does not provide Lua bindings for ADG, but includes a demonstration
program that shows how to use ADG and LGI.


ADG-Lua 0.0.1
=============

Initial release. This adg-lua version is the first one and will be
used to provide bindings for adg-0.6.4 (together with the internal
cpml-0.6.4 library). Anyway it is expected to work with more recent
versions too.
