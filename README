Demo programs and examples on how to use the ADG canvas with
LGI dynamically generated bindings. This requires both ADG
and LGI installed on your system.

This package will install the Lua scripts under $pkgdatadir,
that is usually /usr/local/share/adg-lua.

The following applications are included:

* adg-demo.lua
  A rewrite of the adg-demo program included in the official
  ADG tarball that leverages the LGI Lua bindings. The GTK+
  interface relies on the GtkBuilder file provided by ADG,
  usually found in /usr/local/share/adg/adg-demo.ui.

Have fun.
