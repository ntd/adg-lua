You need lgob installed and working to be able to use adg-lua.
Check the project home page for details:

http://oproj.tuxfamily.org/wiki/doku.php?id=lgob

configure expects lgob to be installed in the system path. The
locations can be overriden by specify them manually, tough:

./configure \
        --with-lua-includedir=<path to header files> \
        --with-lua-lmoduledir=<path to lua modules> \
        --with-lua-cmoduledir=<path to c libraries>

A convenient wrapper to handle the common case where lgob is
installed in $HOME/lua is provided in build/configure-home.

Once all is working and built properly, examples/Adg.lua
should show the same model of adg-demo, without the dialogs
and data editing whistles.

Have fun, if possible.
