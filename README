Demo programs and examples on how to use the ADG canvas with
LGI (Lua bindings generated dynamically). This requires both
ADG and LGI installed on your system.

The build system is based on autotools. It basically checks
that the dependencies are fulfilled at "./configure" time
and it installs the Lua scripts under $pkgdatadir (usually
/usr/local/share/adg-lua) during "make install".

The following applications are included:

* adg-demo.lua
  A rewrite of the adg-demo program included in the official
  ADG tarball that leverages the LGI Lua bindings. The GTK+
  interface relies on the GtkBuilder file provided by ADG,
  usually found in /usr/local/share/adg/adg-demo.ui.

Have fun.
